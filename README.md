# Code Academy Practice

About
-----
This repository holds practice projects that I did on code academy using their Learning Python curriculum. Projects include a simple Battleship game in which the user has 4 turns to guess the location of a battleship randomly placed on a 5x5 board, a grade calculator which calculates weighted letter grades and the class average from hardcoded number scores, and functions that were particularly informative or interesting to me, such as censor() which censors a given word out of the given string of text by replacing it with *'s. 

Future Plans
-----
* Improve battleship.py to include user input for the number of turns and size of the board
* grade_calculator.py will take user input for student names and their grades and provide the individual letter grades and class average
* More functions added to practice_functions.py as I come across them
* More projects from different lessons in code academy: JavaScript, Data Science, and Web Development
